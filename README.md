# FactorioScenarioMultiplayerSpawn
A custom scenario for allowing separate spawn locations in multiplayer. Designed for Co-op and PvE. 

## Read the WIKI
The github wiki page will have the most up to date information. If you have questions, go there first, otherwise just ask.

## Stable Version (Factorio v0.17.69)
At this point master branch is basically stable, I'll help with bug fixes and minor features but I have no large changes planned.

## Credit
Several other portions of the code (tags, frontier style rocket silo) have also been adapted from other scenario code.

Credit to 3Ra for help as well: https://github.com/3RaGaming

Praise be to Mylon

## Random Notes
Feel free to submit bugs/fixes/requests/pulls/forks whatever you want.

I do not plan on supporting PvP, but I will help anyone who wants to make it a configurable option.
